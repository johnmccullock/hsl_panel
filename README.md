# hsl_panel
HSL graph panel for choosing colors.  The design is from PaintShop Pro's color chooser dialog.  I liked it so much I decided to implement in a java swing component.

The hue, saturation and lightness are represented on a color graph.  Hue can be chosen from a color ring spanning the full color spectrum.  Choosing the hue results in different choices for saturation and lightness which can be chosen from a graph (saturation along the x-axis, and lightness along the y-axis).

Keep in mind that this design is probably copywritten by Corel (developers of PaintShop Pro), and this code I've written here isn't intended for anything other than curiosity and educational purposes.
